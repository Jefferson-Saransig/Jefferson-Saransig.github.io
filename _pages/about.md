I am a Ph.D. student in Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. I am a member of the Documentary and Descriptive Linguistics group and work under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Woodbury. My research interests include language contact, sociolinguistics, bilingualism, and Ecuadorian Kichwa (ISO 639-3: *qvi*).

My current research projects focus on:

1. The topic marker *-ka* in conditional constructions in Imbabura Kichwa  
2. Unified and local varieties of Kichwa, approached from a linguistic epidemiology perspective  
3. The use and interpretation of discourse markers in Imbabura Kichwa  

My academic background is in education and language teaching. I am interested in collaborating with projects related to language documentation, revitalization, pedagogy, and bilingual education (contact me!).
